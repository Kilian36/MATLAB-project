# MATLAB-project
A simple MATLAB project, which include statistical analysys of data. The project try to undersand trends of life quality based on tables.
I've used web scraping tools in MATLAB to take data from numbeo.com, a website that trakcs data regarding quality life in different countries 
in all over the world. The tables include data divided by year, the project idea is to identify patterns or trends in the period analysed.

The information is plotted in graphs, where the x-axis represents the time and the y-axis represents quality of life datas, like pollution rate,
climate rate, security.

Unforunately, all the code comments are in italian.
